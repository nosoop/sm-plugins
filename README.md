sm-plugins
==========

A collection of custom SourceMod plugins.  Some heavily modified from elsewhere, some stripped down, some for testing, others not.

~~Released under the MIT license, unless noted in the source otherwise.  
Licensing issues, if any arise, may be raised in the issue tracker.~~

(Apparently, SourceMod-derivative projects must be GPL.  Whoops!  I write plugins; I don't speak legalese.  I'll fix that all soon enough, but consider everything GPL'd.)

If you feel that my contibutions or new creations are valuable, feel free to donate:

## Migrated projects
I've stopped using this repository to hold all of my SourceMod projects, opting to create individual plugin repositories instead.  If a new plugin has been put up that fulfills the purpose of one in this repository, the latter will be deleted and the replacements will be linked to below:

* **Bot Map Overrides**:  Replaced by [nosoop/SM-TFBotMapRunner](https://github.com/nosoop/SM-TFBotMapRunner).
* **Extended Map Configs** (fork):  Replaced by [nosoop/SM-YetAnotherMapConfigPlugin](https://github.com/nosoop/SM-YetAnotherMapConfigPlugin)
